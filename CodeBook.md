This dataset contains 68 variables with 10299 observations.
Each observation is the mean value of the activity metrics grouped by subjectId and activityType.

**Identifiers:**
* subjectId: Unique identifier assigned to each study participant
* activityType: Activity performed by study parcipants while activity measurements were being recorded.
Values include walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.
