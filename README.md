# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The R script run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Downloads locomotion data collected from accelerometers on Samsung Galaxy S smartphones (data source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
2. Merges the training and test data sets into one.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
